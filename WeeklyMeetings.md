### Date:  23rd February 2023

#### Who did you help this week?

Sanna helped Dee find the kaggle datasets.

#### Who helped you this week?

See above. 

#### What did you achieve?

* Found the kaggle datasets (not so straightforward as expected)
	* https://academictorrents.com/details/015f31a94c600256868be155358dc114157507fc	
* Found supplementary data
	* [1st](https://github.com/lfz/DSB2017)
		* [Luna 16 Grand Challenge](https://luna16.grand-challenge.org/Download/)
	* [2nd](https://github.com/juliandewit/kaggle_ndsb2017)
		* None needed
	* [7th](https://github.com/NDKoehler/DataScienceBowl2017_7th_place)
		* [Luna 16 Grand Challenge](https://luna16.grand-challenge.org/Download/)

* We found competitions that are complete, have publically available code, and have publically available data:
	* [RSNA 2022 Cervical Spine Fracture Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/rsna-2022-cervical-spine-fracture-detection)
	* [RSNA Breast Cancer Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/rsna-breast-cancer-detection)
		* Might not have publically available code in time
		* Is it too similar to the Cervical Spine Competition (<9hr run time restriction on code?)
	* 

* We learned that the category "code competition" on kaggle means teams submit code vs a trained model. Therefore competitions with this tag are more likely to have publically available code. We are thinking to narrow our investigation to competitions with the tag **code competition**. Furthermore, these types of competitions have restrictions regarding resources and environments, as well as maximum runtime. This might reduce the amount of confounding factors as well as make it easier to extrapolate on our findings. 

#### What did you struggle with?

* Finding the data for the competition.

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* The following items are needed for each project to work:
	* [1st](https://github.com/lfz/DSB2017)
		* nothing is apparently missing
	* [2nd](https://github.com/juliandewit/kaggle_ndsb2017)
		* nothing is apparently missing
	* [7th](https://github.com/NDKoehler/DataScienceBowl2017_7th_place)
		* Checkpoint folder is required to run the project, but it has been removed from dropbox

* We are moving on from the lung cancer competition for now.
* Download data for cervical spine fracture detection
* Attempt running code for the cervical spine fracture detection competition

#### Where do you need help from Veronika?

* Guidance on problem solving finding the data/missing elements
* Is it safe to download the data to the HPC from the sources we found?
* Regarding competitions with a <9hr runtime requirement, is it ok if we investigate 2 competitions with this requirement?

### Date: 13th February 2023

#### Who did you help this week?

Each other.

#### Who helped you this week?

Google.

#### What did you achieve?

* Found 3 github repos for high ranking teams for the Kaggle lung cancer challenge:
	* 1st https://github.com/lfz/DSB2017
	* 2nd https://github.com/juliandewit/kaggle_ndsb2017
	* 7th https://github.com/NDKoehler/DataScienceBowl2017_7th_place

* Started working on how to actually run the first one.

#### What did you struggle with?

* Working out how to handle requirements for each repo, and looking at how to make the code run.

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* Continue with how to run the first project
* Test the requirements.txt file on Sanna's computer
* Finish setting up a requirements.txt file for HPC
* Start looking at the next submission where code is available

#### Where do you need help from Veronika?

* It seems some packages used are outdated. Is it ok if we use different versions of packages for the environment?
